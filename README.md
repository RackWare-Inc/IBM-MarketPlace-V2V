## Product Overview
RackWare's RMM Migrations are an automated, easy, and convenient process to migrate existing workloads from your current location to IBM Cloud. The support migrated use cases are:
1.	Migration from VMware virtual machine to IBM Cloud VPC VSIs
2.	Migration from bare metal to bare metal within IBM Cloud classic

RMM will create an exact duplicate of a running image without the burden of rebuilding or recreating template images and applications. It decouples the application stack from the underlying platform, allowing it to be ported to the IBM Cloud infrastructure with ease. 

RMM simplifies migration of large complex environments through a simple interface, and reduces the time required from weeks to days, reducing capital and operating expenses. RackWare RMM includes discovery, analysis and automation features, allowing all  processes to be fast, easy, and error-free.


Key Benefits 
- Live Migrations 
- Highly secure and efficient data transfer. 
- Include / Exclude Lists: Capture and “sync only” specific files and directories rather than entire systems. 
- Delta Sync: Sync only the changed parts of files during the final data sync, drastically lowering cutover times. 
- Network optimization: bandwidth usage limitations, compression and check point restart for all sync operations

## Before you begin software installation, make sure you have the following: 
- Proper IBM Cloud account permissions and access 
- Identification of a region and zone where you will want to  deploy the RMM server 
- The region should be under the IBM Cloud account quota for VPC, security groups, and floating IP 
- To know more about IBM VPC, visit https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-started

## Software Installation/Deployment 
The RMM software will come pre-installed as part of the VSI provisioning.  Once VSI is deployed, you can access RMM through the CLI or GUI.  For GUI access, enter the public IP address of the RMM server.  Default credential is admin and rackware for password.  Be sure to change the default password.

# License Requirements 
For migration using the RMM server, the license model is “bring your own license” (BYOL). The license is a subscription-based license, paid monthly.  Each license allows you to migrate one or more servers during the subscription period. Only one server can be migrated at any given time with one license. You will need additional licenses to perform concurrent migrations.  To purchase and install licenses please refer to the Section : License Procurement Process
