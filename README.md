## Product Overview
RackWare's RMM Migrations are an automated, easy and convenient process to move existing workloads
between systems such as bare metal to bare metal, creating an exact duplicate of a running image
without the burden of rebuilding or recreating template images and applications. Migrating large
complex environments through a simple interface and automated tasks reduces the time required from
weeks to days.


RackWareâ€™s RMM software platform delivers a suite of intuitive and automated services that provide
IT resiliency and simplified migration to the cloud, while reducing capital and operating expenses.
RMM decouples the application stack from the underlying platform allowing it to be ported to the IBM
Cloud infrastructure. RackWare RMM includes discovery, analysis and automation features allowing all
processes to be fast, easy and error-free.

Key Benefits
- Live Migrations
- Highly secure and efficient data transfer.
- Include / Exclude Lists: Capture and sync only specific files and directories rather than entire
systems.
- Delta Sync: Sync only the changed parts of files during the final data sync, drastically lowering
cutover times.
- Network optimization: bandwidth usage limitations, compression and check point restart for all
sync operations
